[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/draios/sysdig.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/draios/sysdig)

Welcome to **sysdig** - an open source system-level exploration and troubleshooting tool. 

Where to start?
---
If this is your first time hearing about sysdig, we recommend you [start with the website] (http://www.sysdig.org).  
  
What does sysdig do and why should I use it?
---
Sysdig captures system calls and other system level events using a linux kernel facility called tracepoints, which means much less overhead than tools such as strace.

It then "packetizes" this information, so that you can save it into trace files and filter it, a bit like you would do with tcpdump. This makes it very flexible to explore what processes are doing.

Sysdig is also packed with a set of scripts called Chisels that make it easier to extract useful information and do troubleshooting.
